# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository aims to provide a requirement analysis for the AirBnB clone project

## What is Requirement Analysis
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. 
This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Clarity and Understanding:** It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
- **Scope Definition:** Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
- **Basis for Design and Development:** Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
- **Cost and Time Estimation:** Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
- **Quality Assurance:** Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

### a. Requirement Gathering:
- **Interviews:** Conducting interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.
- **Surveys/Questionnaires:** Distributing surveys to collect requirements from a larger audience.
- **Workshops:** Organizing workshops with stakeholders to discuss and gather requirements.
- **Observation:** Observing end-users in their working environment to understand their needs.
- **Document Analysis:** Reviewing existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.

### b. Requirement Elicitation
- **Brainstorming:** Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.
- **Focus Groups:** Holding focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
- **Prototyping:** Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.

### c. Requirement Documentation
- **Requirement Specification Document:** Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.
- **User Stories:** Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the user’s perspective.
- **Use Cases:** Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.

### d. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
- **Requirement Prioritization:** Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.
- **Feasibility Analysis:** Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
- **Modeling:** Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.

### e. Requirement Validation
- **Review and Approval:** Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
- **Traceability:** Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.

## Types of Requirements
### a. Functional Requirements
Definition: Describe what the system should do.

#### Key Functional Requirements:

- Search Properties: Users should be able to search for properties based on various criteria such as location, price, and availability.
- User Registration: New users should be able to create an account with personal details and login credentials.
- Property Listings: Display properties with essential details and images.
- Booking System: Users should be able to book properties, view booking details, and manage their bookings.
- User Authentication: Secure login and registration process for users.

### b. Non-functional Requirements
Definition: Describe how the system should perform.
Examples: Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.

#### Key Non-functional Requirements:

- Performance: The system should load pages within 2 seconds and handle up to 1000 concurrent users.
- Security: Ensure data encryption, secure login, and protect against common vulnerabilities.
- Scalability: The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle increased traffic.
- Usability: The application should have an intuitive UI/UX, making it easy for users to navigate and perform tasks.
- Reliability: The system should have an uptime of 99.9% and recover quickly from any failures.

## Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams are a type of behavioral diagram used in Unified Modeling Language (UML) to visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and a system. They show the different ways users can interact with a system by identifying key use cases, which are specific functionalities or services the system provides.

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:
- Clarify System Requirements: Help stakeholders understand what the system should do from the user's perspective.
- Improve Communication: Provide a high-level visual that aids communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- Define Scope: Help identify the boundaries and features of the system.
- Facilitate Design and Testing: Serve as a foundation for creating detailed functional specifications and test cases.
- Support User-Centric Design: Focus on user goals, making systems more intuitive and aligned with user needs.

## Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis
Acceptance Criteria are clear, specific conditions that a software product must meet for a feature to be accepted by stakeholders (typically the client or product owner). In requirement analysis, they are crucial because they:

- Define Scope and Expectations: Clarify what "done" means for a requirement or feature.
- Reduce Misunderstandings: Ensure that developers, testers, and stakeholders have a shared understanding of what to build.
- Enable Testability: Provide a basis for creating test cases and verifying functionality.
- Guide Development: Help developers focus on exactly what needs to be implemented.
- Support Agile Practices: Integral to user stories in Agile/Scrum, promoting incremental and quality delivery.

### Acceptance Criteria for a Checkout Feature in the Booking Management System
Feature: Checkout – allows users to finalize and confirm their booking.

### Acceptance Criteria:

- User must be logged in to access the checkout page.
- Booking summary (property name, dates, number of guests, price breakdown) is displayed before payment.
- User must provide valid payment information (credit/debit card or supported payment method).
- System must validate payment details before processing.
- On successful payment, a booking confirmation is shown, and a confirmation email is sent to the user.
- If payment fails, an appropriate error message is displayed, and the booking is not created.
- User cannot proceed to checkout if the selected dates are no longer available.
